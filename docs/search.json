Howard Creekmore Professor of Finance and Professor of Economics kerryback@gmail.com\n\n\n\n\nTime Value of Money by Kerry Back\nCorporate Finance by Ivo Welch\n\n\n\n\nThis course is an introduction to investments, including the analysis of corporate investment projects. We begin with foundational issues such as retirement planning and mortgage calculations. The next part of the course describes markets, assets, and properties of returns. We then study how to construct efficient portfolios of assets. The final part of the course pertains to the financial analysis of corporate projects.\nOur analysis tool throughout most of the course will be python. Python is both more transparent and quicker to write than are spreadsheets, which are conventional for a lot of the topics we will discuss. Furthermore, the use of python will allow us to go deeper into some of our topics than is possible with spreadsheets.\nCode snippets are sprinkled throughout the slides. Those snippets – plus the code used to generate all figures in the slides – are posted at the “Code Binder” link above. Clicking on that link will open a JupyterLab environment in your web browser. If you wish to do so, you can work in that environment for your assignments by launching a new notebook or modifying an existing notebook and downloading it. The binder is slow to load, so be patient.Alternatively, you can download notebooks from the github repo linked in the banner above.\n\n\n\nThere are seven sets of weekly assignments, due by midnight each Wednesday beginning January 22. The final grade will be based equally on the seven assignments."

If there are multiple questions in an assignment, copy each question into a Markdown cell and provide your answer in the cell or cells below it.\n\n\nDownload adjusted closing prices for CVX and SPY from Yahoo Finance and compute annual returns. Get the prices with only one call to the pandas datareader by inputting the list [“CVX”, “SPY”] as the first argument. Use “1970-01-01” as the start date and “2021-12-31” as the end date. Use the code from class to compute the annual returns.\nSome things worth pointing out:\n\nThe CVX returns will start in 1971 because when you down-sample to the last date of the year, the first date will be the end of 1970 and then when you compute percent changes the first non-missing value will be for 1971.\n\nSPY did not exist before 1993, so you will get NaNs as adjusted closing prices for SPY prior to 1993.\n\nYou cannot use an earlier start date than “1970-01-01” because Yahoo does not provide data prior to 1970.\nThe name of Chevron Corp. and its ticker symbol changed several times over the years as it changed from being part of Standard Oil and then acquired Texaco. But all of the data is available from Yahoo under the ticker symbol CVX.\n\n\n\n\nDownload adjusted closing prices for AAPL and compute daily, monthly, and annual returns for the five-year period 2017-2021. Construct three box plots - one for each set of returns. Use “2016-12-30” as the start date. What can we tell about outliers from the box plots?\n\n\n\nUsing Yahoo’s adjusted closing prices, compute annual returns for AAPL for the period 2000 through 2021. Calculate the arithmetic average annual return and the geometric average annual return.\n\n\n\nDraw 1,000 sets of 30 normally distributed random variables with a mean of 6% and a standard deviation of 10%. Viewing the variables as annual returns, compound them year by year over each 30-year period to obtain 1,000 time series of accumulations .\n\nCalculate and plot the standard deviation of the accumulations through each year (the x-axis should be 1, 2, …, 30 and the y-axis should be the std dev of the accumulation through year 1, year 2, …, year 30).\nIf the accumulation is less than 1, then an investment has lost money. Calculate and plot the fraction of the 1,000 returns for which the accumulation is less than 1 year-by-year (the plot should be the same as in (1) but the y-axis should have the fraction of losses through year 1, year 2, …, year 30)."

    "text": "Kerry Back  J. Howard Creekmore Professor of Finance and Professor of Economics kerryback@gmail.com\n\n\n\n\nTime Value of Money by Kerry Back\nCorporate Finance by Ivo Welch\n\n\n\n\nThis course is an introduction to investments, including the analysis of corporate investment projects. We begin with foundational issues such as retirement planning and mortgage calculations. The next part of the course describes markets, assets, and properties of returns. We then study how to construct efficient portfolios of assets. The final part of the course pertains to the financial analysis of corporate projects.\nOur analysis tool throughout most of the course will be python. Python is both more transparent and quicker to write than are spreadsheets, which are conventional for a lot of the topics we will discuss. Furthermore, the use of python will allow us to go deeper into some of our topics than is possible with spreadsheets.\nCode snippets are sprinkled throughout the slides. Those snippets – plus the code used to generate all figures in the slides – are posted at the “Code Binder” link above. Clicking on that link will open a JupyterLab environment in your web browser. If you wish to do so, you can work in that environment for your assignments by launching a new notebook or modifying an existing notebook and downloading it. The binder is slow to load, so be patient.Alternatively, you can download notebooks from the github repo linked in the banner above.\n\n\n\nThere are seven sets of weekly assignments, due by midnight each Wednesday beginning January 22. The final grade will be based equally on the seven assignments."
