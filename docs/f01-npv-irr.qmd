## Net present value (NPV)

- Present value of cash flows, some negative and some positive
- Cash inflows positive, cash outflows negative
- Positive NPV means that cash inflows could finance cash outflows with something left over - at the given rate of return
- Most important calculation for financial analysis of corporate projects
- Positive NPV $\Rightarrow$ take project

## Required rate of return

. . .

Rate of return used to discount cash flows is called required rate

- Rate the company requires
- Rate investors require
- Rate investors could earn on their own with comparable risk

## Internal rate of return (IRR)

- IRR is break-even rate of return, meaning NPV = 0
- Usually, positive NPV $\Leftrightarrow$ IRR > required rate of return
- Create value for investors with NPV > 0 $\Leftrightarrow$ earning more than required rate.

## Calculating IRR

- Cash flows $C_0, C_1, \ldots, C_n$
- PV factors depending on $r$:

. . .

$$1, \frac{1}{1+r}, \ldots, \frac{1}{(1+r)^n}$$

- Solve

. . .

$$C_0 + \frac{C_1}{1+r} + \cdots + \frac{C_n}{(1+r)^n} = 0$$

- Polynomial equation in $1/(1+r)$

. . .

```{.p code-line-numbers="1|3|4"}
C0, C1, C2, C3, C4 = -100, 30, 40, 50, 40

import numpy_financial as npf
npf.irr((C0, C1, C2, C3, C4))
```

. . .

```{python}
C0, C1, C2, C3, C4 = -100, 30, 40, 50, 40

import numpy_financial as npf
npf.irr((C0, C1, C2, C3, C4))
```
