Let's track a retirement account balance monthly.

<br>

For simplicity, assume the return is the same each month.

<br>

We'll first track it in a loop, then use future values.

## Our goal

![](images/sleepingwell.jpg)

## Timing


- Today is date 0, date 1 is 1 month away, $\ldots$
- Date R (R months away) is our retirement date
- We plan to live until date $T>R$.
- We make deposits at dates $1, 2, \ldots, R$
- We make withdrawals at the beginning of each month of retirement: dates $R, R+1, \ldots, T-1$
- Our account balance today is $B_0$.
- We earn a monthly return $r$.

## Constant dollars

- It is most useful to do this exercise in today's dollars.
- Think about what your deposits and withdrawals will be in today's dollars.
- The monthly return should be the real return.

## Deposit period


- At date 1, we have $(1+r)B_0$ and deposit $D_1$, so $B_1 = (1+r)B_0 + D_1$.
- Likewise, $B_2 = (1+r)B_1 + D_2$. This is
the future value $(1+r)^2 B_0 + (1+r)D_1 + D_2$.
- Etc., until 

. . .

$$B_R = (1+r)^R B_0 + (1+r)^{R-1} D_1  + \cdots +  D_R$$

## Withdrawals
- At date $R$, we also make a withdrawal $W_R$
- Then earn $r$ and make another withdrawal $W_{R+1}$.
- Continue through the last withdrawal at $T-1$.
- The account balance evolves always as the future value of all past deposits and withdrawals.

## Ending balance

. . .

The ending balance is

. . .

$$(1+r)^T B_0 + (1+r)^{T-1}D_1 + \cdots + (1+r)^{T-R}D_R$$

. . .

minus

$$(1+r)^{T-R}W_R + \cdots + (1+r)W_{T-1}$$

## Deposit and withdrawal arrays

- Let D be an array of deposits (of length $R$).
- Let W be an array of withdrawals (of length $T-R$).
- To escape the normal counting from zero, let's make them dictionaries with keys being the dates $1, \ldots, R, \ldots, T$.

. . .

```{.python code-line-numbers="1|2"}
D = dict(zip(range(1, R+1), D)})
W = dict(zip(range(R, T), W)})
```

## Example <a href="https://bbcx-investments.com/borrowing-saving/retirement-planning"><img src="images/Rice_Owl.jpg" style="width:.8in;" align="right"> </a>

- Assume deposits grow at some rate $g$, so $D_t = (1+g)D_{t-1}$.
- Assume withdrawals grow (or decline) at some rate $h$, so $W_t = (1+h)W_{t-1}$.

. . .

```{.p code-line-numbers="1-6|7-8"}
R = 30*12      # 30 years until retirement
T = 60*12      # 60 total years
r = 0.005      # earn 1/2 % per month  (~ 6% per year)
B0 = 100000    # initial balance is $100,000
D1 = 1000      # initial savings is $1,000 (per month)
W1 = 10000     # withdraw $10,000 first month in retirement
g = 0.002      # deposit is 0.2% larger each month
h = 0          # withdrawals are constant
```

## Deposits and withdrawals

```{.python code-line-numbers="1-2|4-5"}
D = D1 * (1+g)**np.arange(R)
W = W1 * (1+h)**np.arange(T-R)

D = dict(zip(range(1, R+1), D)})
W = dict(zip(range(R, T), W)})
```

## Account balance

```{.python code-line-numbers="1-2|4-5|7|9-10|12"}
B = np.zeros(T+1)
B[0] = B0

for t in range(1, R+1) :               
    B[t] = (1+r)*B[t-1] + D[t] 

B[R] -= W[R]

for t in range(R+1, T):
    B[t] = (1+r)*B[t-1] - W[t]

B[T] = (1+r)*B[T-1]
```


## Final balance as sum of future values

```{.p code-line-numbers="11|1|3-5|7-9|11|13-14"}
x = (1+r)**T

grFactors = (1+g)**np.arange(R)
fvFactors = (1+r)**np.arange(T-1, T-R-1, -1)
y = np.sum(grFactors*fvFactors)

grFactors = (1+h)**np.arange(T-R)
fvFactors = (1+r)**np.arange(T-R, 0, -1)
z = np.sum(grFactors*fvFactors)

BT = x*B0 + y*D1 - z*W1

# example: solve for D1 to make BT=0
D1 = (z*W1 - x*B0) / y
```

## Success!
