## Frontier is a line 

- The frontier portfolios are all scalar multiples of the vector $C^{-1}(\bar{r}-r_f1_n)$.
- The scalar determines how much is saved or borrowed.
- For some value of the scalar, there is no saving or borrowing.
- For this value of the scalar, the portfolio is called the [tangency portfolio]{style="color:tomato; font-weight:bold"}.
- The mean-variance frontier is the line from the risk-free rate through the tangency portfolio.



## Tangency

- Consider the same minimum variance problem but without saving or borrowing.
- This adds the constraint $1_n^\top w=1$.
- This frontier is a hyperbola.
- The line through the tangency portfolio just touches the hyperbola.  It is tangent to the hyperbola at the tangency portfolio.
