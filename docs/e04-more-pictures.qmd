## Effect of short sales constraints <a href="https://bbcx-investments.com/portfolios/short-sales-constraints"><img src="images/Rice_Owl.jpg" style="width:.65in;" align=right vertical-align=center></a>

- The effect of short sales constraints depends on correlations and differences in expected returns.
- If there are assets or portfolios with different expected returns and high correlations, shorting can be useful.
- E.g., if you think CVX will beat XOM, then buy CVX and short XOM.

## Different saving and borrowing rates <a href="https://bbcx-investments.com/portfolios/optimal-two-rates"><img src="images/Rice_Owl.jpg" style="width:.65in;" align=right vertical-align=center></a>

- Two tangency portfolios, one at the saving rate and second at the borrowing rate
- Frontier/optimal portfolios are the union of
  1. Save $x_s$ and invest $1-x_s$ in the saving-rate tangency portfolio
  2. Hold a combination of the two tangency portfolios (without saving or borrowing)
  3. Borrow $x_b$ and invest $1+x_b$ in the borrowing-rate tangency portfolio

# 

- This is true unless the borrowing rate is too high.  Then replace 2 and 3 with "hold risky-only frontier portfolios."
