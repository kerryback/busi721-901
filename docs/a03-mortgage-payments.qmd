## Questions about loans

- I know how much I want to borrow and for how many years and what the rate will be.  What will my payment be?
- I know how much I can afford to pay and for how many years the loan will be and what the rate will be.  How much can I borrow?
- I know how much I want to borrow and what I can afford to pay and for how many years the loan will be.  What rate do I need to get?

#

- Suppose we borrow for $T$ years at an annual rate of $r$ with monthly payments.
- Our monthly rate will be $r_m = r/12$.
- Each month, we incur interest equal to $r_m$ times the beginning-of-month balance.  
- Our payment goes first to interest, then the remainder to principal, reducing the outstanding balance.
- Next month's interest charge is smaller, so more goes towards principal.
- The last payment is equal to the beginning-of-month balance plus interest on the balance.

#

- Call the amount borrowed (principal of the loan) $B$ and the payment $P$.
- What we owe just after the first payment is
$(1+r_m)B-P$.
- What we owe just after the second payment is
 
 . . .

$$(1+r_m)((1+r_m)B - P) - P$$

- This is $(1+r_m)^2 B - (1+r_m)P - P$, which is the future value of the amount borrowed minus the future value of the payments (as of the end of the second month).

- Because the loan is eventually paid off, the future value of the amount borrowed equals the future value of the payments as of the end of the last month.

## Future values

- The balance after the last payment is zero.
- So, for future values as of the loan maturity,

. . .

$$0 = \text{FV(Principal)} - \text{FV(Payments)}$$

. . .

Equivalently,

$$\text{FV(Principal)} = \text{FV(Payments)}$$

## Present values

- Because future values are equal, present values are also equal.
- The present value of the amount borrowed is just the amount (prinicpal).
- So loan terms are related by Principal = PV of payments.
- With a monthly payment of $P$, a monthly rate of $r_m$, and a loan term of $T$ years, the PV of payments is

. . .

$$P \times \left(\frac{1}{1+r_m} + \frac{1}{(1+r_m)^2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{(1+r_m)^{12 \times T}}\right)$$

## Annuity factor

- The sum of PV factors is called the annuity factor AF.
- So, Principal = Payment $\times$ AF.
- There is a simpler formula for the annuity factor (sum of a finite number of terms of a geometric series):

. . .

$$\text{AF} = \frac{1}{r_m}\left(1 - \frac{1}{(1+r_m)^{12 \times T}}\right)$$

- It is not necessary to remember the AF formula.

## Balloon payments

- A loan might have a balloon payment, meaning a lump sum payment at the end.
- Loan terms are related by Principal = PV of monthly payments + PV of balloon
- PV of balloon is

. . .

$$\frac{\text{Balloon}}{(1+r_m)^{12 \times T}}$$

## Numpy financial

- You may need to do 
<br>[pip install numpy-financial]{style="font-family:courier; font-weight:bold; color:tomato;"}
- Convention is that payments, including balloon, are negative.
- Principal received is positive.  It is called [pv]{style="font-family:courier; font-weight:bold; color:tomato;"}.
- Ballon is called [fv]{style="font-family:courier; font-weight:bold; color:tomato;"}.
- Functions are [rate, pmt, pv, fv]{style="font-family:courier; font-weight:bold; color:tomato;"}.
- Same functions are in Excel.

## Example  <a href="https://bbcx-investments.com/borrowing-saving/amortization"><img src="images/Rice_Owl.jpg" style="width:.8in;" align="right"> </a>


```p
import numpy_financial as npf
 
nper = 30 * 12       # 30 year loan
principal = 400000   # borrow $400,000
pmt = -1500          # pay $1,500 per month
rate = 0.04 / 12     # annual rate is 4%
balloon = 0          # no balloon
```

. . .

We'll calculate each of the last four, one at a time, given the other inputs.

#

```{.p code-line-numbers="1-2|4-5|7-8|10-11"}
# Question 1: what will my payment be?
PMT = npf.pmt(rate=rate, nper=nper, pv=principal, fv=balloon)
 
# Question 2: how much can I borrow?
PRINCIPAL = npf.pv(rate=rate, nper=nper, pmt=pmt, fv=balloon)

# Question 3: what will my rate be?
RATE = npf.rate(nper=nper, pv=principal, pmt=pmt, fv=balloon)

# And, how much of a balloon do I need?
BALLOON = npf.fv(rate=rate, nper=nper, pmt=pmt, pv=principal)
```

If BALLOON>0, you overpaid the bank and should get money back.
